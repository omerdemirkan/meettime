## How does it work?

Once signed in, a user is able to create a survey with an event name, date and identifier which determines what the user submitter will be asked to identify themselves (i.e First Name, Full Name, Alias). 
After this, the user is given a sharable link, with chich anyone may access. With this link, people can give their availabilities during the specified date and the user can see these submissions. The user may search for available times with number of people (everyone, 3 people, etc.) and by individual submission.
